The set `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` contains a total of `n!` unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for `n = 3`:

1. "123"
2. "132"
3. "213"
4. "231"
5. "312"
6. "321"

Given `n` and `k`, return the `kth` permutation sequence.

## Test Cases

**Example 1:** 
```
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```

**Example 2:** 
```
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```
