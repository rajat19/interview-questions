Given a binary tree and target node. By giving the fire to the target node and fire starts to spread in a complete tree. 
The task is to print the total time to burn every node of the binary tree

Rules for burning the nodes :
1. Fire will spread constantly to the connected nodes only.
2. Every node takes the same time to burn.
3. A node burns only once.
