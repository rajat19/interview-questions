One simple way to encrypt a string is to "rotate" every alphanumeric character by a certain amount. Rotating a character means replacing it with another character that is a certain number of steps away in normal alphabetic or numerical order.
For example, if the string "Zebra-493?" is rotated 3 places, the resulting string is "Cheud-726?". Every alphabetic character is replaced with the character 3 letters higher (wrapping around from Z to A), and every numeric character replaced with the character 3 digits higher (wrapping around from 9 to 0). Note that the non-alphanumeric characters remain unchanged.
Given a string and a rotation factor, return an encrypted string.

## Test Cases

**Example 1:** 
```
input = Zebra-493?
rotationFactor = 3
output = Cheud-726?
```

**Example 2:** 
```
input = abcdefghijklmNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789
rotationFactor = 39
output = nopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLM9012345678
```
