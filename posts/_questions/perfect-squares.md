Given an integer `n`, return the _least number of perfect square numbers that sum to_ `n`.

A *perfect square* is an integer that is the square of an integer; 
in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. 
For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.
