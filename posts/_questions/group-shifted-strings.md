We can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter.
* For example, `"abc"` can be shifted to be `"bcd"`.

We can keep shifting the string to form a sequence.
* For example, we can keep shifting `"abc"` to form the sequence: `"abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"`.

* Given an array of strings `strings`, group all `strings[i]` that belong to the same shifting sequence. 
* You may return the answer in **any order**.

## How to Solve

The relative distance between each letter of the string and the first character is equal.

For example, `abc` and `efg` are mutually offset. 
For abc, the distance between b and a is 1, and the distance between c and a is 2. 
For efg, the distance between f and e is 1, and the distance between g and e is 2.

Letâ€™s look at another example. 
The distance between az and yx, z and a is 25, and the distance between x and y is also 25 (direct subtraction is -1, 
which is the reason for adding 26 and taking the remainder).

Then, in this case, all strings that are offset from each other have a unique distance difference. 
According to this, the mapping can be well grouped.

## Test Cases

**Example 1:**
```
Input: strings = ["abc","bcd","acef","xyz","az","ba","a","z"]
Output: [["acef"],["a","z"],["abc","bcd","xyz"],["az","ba"]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: strings = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

**Constraints**
* `1 <= strings.length <= 200`
* `1 <= strings[i].length <= 50`
* `strings[i] consists of lowercase English letters.`
