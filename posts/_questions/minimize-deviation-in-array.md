You are given an array nums of `n` positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:

- If the element is **even, divide it by 2**. 
For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be `[1,2,3,2]`.
- If the element is **odd, multiply it by 2**.
For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be `[2,2,3,4]`.

The **deviation** of the array is the **maximum difference** between any two elements in the array.

Return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.

## Test Cases

**Input:**
```
(int[]) nums = [1,2,3,4]
```

**Output:**
```
(int) 1
```

**Explanation:**
```
You can transform the array to [1,2,3,2], then to [2,2,3,2], then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.
```

**Input:**
```
(int[]) nums = [4,1,5,20,3]
```

**Output:**
```
(int) 3
```

**Explanation:**
```
You can transform the array after two operations to [4,2,5,5,3], then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.
```
