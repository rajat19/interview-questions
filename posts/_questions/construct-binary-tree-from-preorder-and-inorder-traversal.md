Given two integer arrays `preorder` and `inorder` where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, 
construct and return the binary tree.

## Test Cases

**Example 1:** 
```
Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
```

**Example 2:** 
```
Input: preorder = [-1], inorder = [-1]
Output: [-1]
```
