Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.
**Note:** You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

## Test Cases
**Example 1:**
```
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
```
 
**Constraints:**
	
* `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200`
	
* `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only.
	
* Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.
