Given a string s of `'('` , `')'` and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( `'('` or `')'`, in any positions ) 
so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:
- It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
- It can be written as `AB` (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
- It can be written as `(A)`, where A is a valid string.

```
Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"

```

**Example 2:** 
```
Input: s = "))(("
Output: ""
Explanation: An empty string is also valid.
