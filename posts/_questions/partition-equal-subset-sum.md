Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, 
find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

---

## Test Cases

**Example 1:** 
```
Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
```

**Example 2:** 
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
