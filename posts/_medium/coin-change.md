You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and 
an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return the _fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. 
If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
