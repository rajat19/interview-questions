Given a balanced parentheses string `s`, return the score of the string.

The score of a balanced parentheses string is based on the following rule:
- `"()"` has score `1`.
- `AB` has score `A + B`, where `A` and `B` are balanced parentheses strings.
- `(A)` has score `2 * A`, where `A` is a balanced parentheses string.
