There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. 
However, the order among letters are unknown to you. 
You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. 
Derive the order of letters in this language.

Note:
1. You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
2. You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
3. If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
4. There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.
