## Test Cases

**Example 1:**

{% include matrix.html rows=5 cols=5 matrix='1,0,1,0,0,10,1,1:$green,1:$green,1,1,1,1:$green,1:$green,1,0,0,1,0' %}

```
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4

```

**Example 2:** 

{% include matrix.html rows=2 cols=2 matrix='0,1:$green,1:$red,0' %}

```
Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
