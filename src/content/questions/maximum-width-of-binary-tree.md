Given the root of a binary tree, return the **_maximum width_** of the given tree.

The **maximum width** of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.

The **width** of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
